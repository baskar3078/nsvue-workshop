# Introduction

In these workshops, you'll be building a complete mobile app that can run on your iOS or Android device. Before getting started, you might be curious about the tools we'll use.

## What is NativeScript?

NativeScript is an open source framework for building truly native mobile applications using JavaScript.

## What is Vue.js?

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like `view`, also often called `Vue.js`) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

## What is NativeScript-Vue?

NativeScript-Vue is a custom implementation of Vue.js which allows you to use the framework to craft your mobile application.

If you have used Vue.js before you will feel right at home with NativeScript-Vue.

## Why would I use this?

**Maybe you need a truly native iOS and Android app:**

NativeScript builds your apps using native user interface components on iOS and Android. The apps you build are not web-based, and therefore are not subject to the limitations inherent in WebView-based application frameworks. NativeScript also provides an extensive collection of plugins to tie into native device features. So if you need to tie into an iOS or Android API or feature as part of your app, you can do that with NativeScript.

**Maybe you like JavaScript, and don't want to write two apps in native languages:**

With NativeScript, you write your mobile applications in JavaScript ‚Äî not Objective-C, not Swift, and not Java. If you like JavaScript, you‚Äôll love writing native iOS and Android apps with the same language you use in your Web and/or Node apps.

**Maybe you like Vue:**

Vue is known for its simple approach to building for the web. If you like building web apps with Vue, you‚Äôll be right at home with NativeScript-Vue, as you‚Äôll be using the same syntax for handling common tasks like data binding and event handling.

## What‚Äôs the catch?

If you have existing Vue experience, you might be surprised at the template syntax required by NativeScript-Vue.

**Learning the NativeScript UI components:**

Because NativeScript uses native user interface components, HTML controls like `<div>` and `<span>` don‚Äôt exist in NativeScript. Instead you‚Äôll need to learn a new set of components you can use to render your interfaces. Layouts often prove particularly tricky for new users, but you can learn more about them [here](http://nslayouts.com).
