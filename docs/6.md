## Some challenges

Now that you've built your app, there are a lot more things you can do to make it better. Here are some ideas:

-   Put your data in a Vuex store
-   Refactor the card markup to be a reusable child component
-   Change the Past/Present/Future layout to be a different [Tarot layout](https://www.thoughtco.com/tarot-card-spreads-2562807), such as the "Celtic Cross"
-   Move the Tarot data into a GraphQL database, or port it elsewhere and make API calls against it
-   Change the One Card page to change only when the date changes so that it's a true "Daily Reading". More cool: save the date in Application Settings and test against that
-   Find a way to store cards and retrieve them
-   Find a way for a Querant to make notes about various readings and their dates
